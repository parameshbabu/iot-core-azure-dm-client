# Samples

Microsoft has created a sample implementation for the application on the device as well as the operators application. You can find these samples on in ms-iot/iot-core-azure-dm-client/samples. This will provide the foundation to build fully functional Device Management into your device.

Here is a high level description of what is there:

1. **Toaster** - a foreground UI *Device Application* representing a fictional smart toaster.  In this case, device management is a part of the *Device Application*.  This is a UWP app that can be deployed from Visual Studio (using either Build > Deploy Solution or F5).
1. **IoTDMBackground** - a Background Application enabling simple device managment independent of any UI app.  In this case the *Device Application* is totally separated from the device management.  This is a UWP Background Application that can be deployed from Visual Studio (using either Build > Deploy Solution or F5).
1. **DMDashboard** - a *Device Dashboard* allowing registered smart toasters to be managed.  This is a .NET desktop application that can be built and run from Visual Studio.

## Running the Samples

To leverage these items on your IotCore device, follow these steps (steps below assume Toaster, but will work if applied to IoTDMBackground as well):

1. Setup your **Azure IotHub** account.
1. Install **Visual Studio 2015 Update 3** (be sure UWP features are enabled)
1. Setup your IotCore device using **IoT Dashboard**
1. Download the [iot-core-azure-dm-client code](https://github.com/ms-iot/iot-core-azure-dm-client) from github and open **IoTDM.sln** in Visual Studio
    + Update samples\Toaster\ConnectionStringProvider.cs to use appropriate IotHub device connection string.
1. Configure the Toaster project as the StartUp project by selecting Toaster in the Solution Explorer and selecting **Set as StartUp Project** in the Project  menu (this option is also available in the Solution Explorer's right click context menu).
1. Set the Configuration to x86 and **Build > Rebuild Solution**
1. Set the Configuration as required by your device and **Build > Rebuild Solution**
1. Deploy to your device by selecting Remote Machine, entering your device's IP address (or name), and **Build > Deploy Solution**.
1. Using SSH (or PowerShell) connect to your device as Administrator.
1. Verify that **SystemConfigurator.exe** and **CommProxy.exe** are present:

        Toaster with Debug ARM configuration: C:\Data\Users\DefaultAccount\AppData\Local\DevelopmentFiles\ToasterUiVS.Debug_ARM.msft
        IoTDMBackground with Debug ARM configuration: C:\Data\Users\DefaultAccount\AppData\Local\DevelopmentFiles\23983CETAthensQuality.IoTDMBackgroundSampleVS.Debug_ARM.msft

1. From **SSH** shell, run (assuming Toaster app with Debug ARM configuration, for IoTDMBackground use path specified in previous step):

        cd C:\Data\Users\DefaultAccount\AppData\Local\DevelopmentFiles\ToasterUiVS.Debug_ARM.msft
        net stop SystemConfigurator
        SystemConfigurator.exe -remove
        SystemConfigurator.exe -install
        net start SystemConfigurator

1. From **Visual Studio**, use F5 to launch Toaster app.  This should bring the **Toaster** app to your device and start it.
1. Run **DMDashboard** on your desktop by launching DMDashboard.exe
    + DMDashboard can trigger reboot in device, get and change time info, get and change device status, and install an App by using Azure blob storage.

For production environments, see [OEM Device Setup](oem-device-setup.md).
